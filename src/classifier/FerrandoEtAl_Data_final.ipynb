    "## Beware the Contrastive Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "In the contrastive trick we subtract the feature activiations of a 'known' entity from the feature activations of an unknown entity. We can sum or average the differences over a batch of such pairs, getting the most different features between each set. Negative features are those which indicate hallucination, positive features indicate non-hallucination.We can repeat this batched process over the entire data set and union the resulting features from each batch into a single distinct list of feature differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "BUT\n",
    "\n",
    "As per Ferrando et al, we want the features which are activated almost exclusively in one condition (known vs. unknown) but rarely or  never activate in the other condition. We are interested in exclusivity not scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply summing the per-batch differences in activations is not well-suited to detecting exclusive features. Summation over subsets will highlight features that have large aggregate differences. This will include the exclusive features we seek, but will not isolate them. We wont know which if the differing features are alsmost exclusive to one class or other.\n",
    "\n",
    "So\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow the approach by Ferrando et al, see p4 of 'Do I know this entity?': \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "For each latent, we obtain the fraction of the time that it is active (i.e. has a value greater than zero) on known and unknown entities respectively...Then, we take the difference, obtaining the latent separation scores\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve this, we need to get the activated features from each and every prompt, we can't use the contrastive trick as per above."
