Her temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 184/111 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in the patient's upper and lower extremities. The patient's memory is intact and her speech seems normal and fluent. Her gait is stable with no ataxia. An initial head CT demonstrates diffuse atrophy which is consistent with previous head CT scans. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\n",

      "A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a productive cough. His cough has been increasing in frequency and severity over the course of 3 days, and his sputum production has increased in volume. The color of his sputum is yellow-green. He denies any chest pain or palpitations but has experienced worsening shortness of breath with exertion and at rest, which is above his baseline. He has not noticed any changes in his weight or edema in his lower extremities. He denies any recent history of long travel. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been hospitalized four times for similar symptoms within the last year. He has smoked approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 156/94 mmHg, pulse is 101/min, and respirations are 26/min with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. On physical exam, the patient has difficulty speaking, and there is asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration. Wheezing is appreciated on pulmonary auscultation. An ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm. A chest radiograph is obtained, and he is administered supplemental oxygen. He is started on ipratropium, albuterol, and methylprednisolone.
